### MYSQL 5.7 Permissions


The error "Access denied for user 'root'@'10.244.1.28' (using password: YES)" indicates that MySQL is not permitting the 'root' user to connect from that IP address.

By default, the MySQL docker image is configured to not allow the root user to connect remotely. It only allows connections from localhost (127.0.0.1). To override this, you can provide a custom MySQL configuration file that allows the root user to connect from any host.

Here is how you can do this:

1. Create a custom MySQL configuration file (e.g., `my.cnf`) and include the following:

   ```sql
   [mysqld]
   skip-host-cache
   skip-name-resolve
   bind-address = 0.0.0.0
   ```

2. Create a ConfigMap from this file:

   ```bash
   kubectl create configmap mysql-config --from-file=my.cnf
   ```

3. Modify your MySQL deployment to use this ConfigMap:

   ```yaml
   spec:
     containers:
     - name: mysql
       image: mysql:5.7
       ports:
       - containerPort: 3306
       env:
       - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
         value: "h3ll0w0rld"
       volumeMounts:
       - name: mysql-config-volume
         mountPath: /etc/mysql/conf.d
     volumes:
     - name: mysql-config-volume
       configMap:
         name: mysql-config
   ```

This configuration should allow the root user to connect from any IP. Please note that this method does not follow best practices for security. It's generally not recommended to allow the root user to connect from any host, especially if your MySQL server is exposed to the internet.

If you're still having trouble, consider creating a separate user specifically for Ghost, as I explained in my previous message. This user should have all privileges on the `ghost` database and be allowed to connect from any host. This setup is more secure and generally recommended for production environments.
